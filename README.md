# 🏎️ F1 GOAT Ranking System (Data-Driven Analysis)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes **Formula 1 driver performance** across seasons to generate a **GOAT (Greatest of All Time) ranking** using data-driven metrics.
Instead of hype or opinions, the ranking is based on **consistent performance, wins, podiums, championships, and race results**.

The goal is to answer one question:

> *Who truly dominates F1 history when stats speak louder than bias?*

---

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used contains historical Formula 1 data including:

* Races
* Drivers
* Constructors
* Results & status
* Championship outcomes

📁 Source: Kaggle – *Formula 1 World Championship (1950–2020)*

---

## 🧠 Methodology

The ranking system is built by:

1. Cleaning and merging multiple F1 datasets
2. Aggregating driver-level performance metrics
3. Assigning weighted scores based on:

   * Race wins
   * Podium finishes
   * Championships
   * Consistency across seasons
4. Calculating a **final F1 GOAT score**
5. Ranking drivers based on the computed score

This approach ensures **fair comparison across different eras** of Formula 1.
